test for
    - Camera
    - Switch between auto schemes
    - Autocode
        - Driverotation %
        - Drivedistance % 
        - WaitUntilPeakShooterRPM % 
        - Driverotation(limelight.getHorizontalOffset())
        - AimRevDistance
    - Climber code
        - Climber switch scheme with individual climbers  
        - Slow move 
        % everything tested  
    - Basic controls
        - Intake backwards and forwards each mode
        - Index backwards and forwards each mode
        - Shooter analog
        % basic/manual controls are working correctly
    - Semi Auto controls
        % working
    - WaitUntilPeakShooterRPM
        % Finished tuning and testing
    - IndexRevolve
        % Tuned and tested
    - actually shooting balls

tuning
    Driverotation (kP and minimum)
        % Finished tuning and it works really good
    Drivedistance (kP and minimum)
        % Finished tuning and it works
    WaitUntilPeakShooterRPM (Percentage and wait time)
        % Finished tuning and testing
    IndexFromIntake, i.e prime a ball in intake (need to adjust rotations possibly)
        % finished tuning and testing
    limelight (angle (getting it and deciding it))
