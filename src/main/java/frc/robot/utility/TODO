    - Camera
    - Driverotation
    - Autocode
        - Driverotation
        - Drivedistance
        - Driverotation(limelight.getHorizontalOffset())
        - WaitUntilPeakShooterRPM

        - Sendable Chooser
    - Climber code
        - Climber switch scheme with individual climbers

tuning
    Driverotation (kP and minimum)
    Drivedistance (kP and minimum)
    WaitUntilPeakShooterRPM (Percentage and wait time)
    IndexFromIntake, i.e prime a ball in intake (need to adjust rotations possibly)
    limelight (angle (getting it and deciding it))
