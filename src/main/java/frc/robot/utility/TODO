TODO LIST
- Testing
    + Climber code
    + Auto code
    + Aim shoot then index after drive rotation is tuned
        - Test Aim
        - Test WaitUntilPeakShooterRPM
        - Test Driverotation

Set up tests for
    - Camera
    - Driverotation
    - Drivedistance
    - Climber
    - Shuffleboard
    - Driverotation
    - Basic controls
        - Intake backwards and forwards each mode
        - Index backwards and forwards each mode 
    - WaitUntilPeakShooterRPM
    - IndexRevolve, doesn't work?

semi auto: driver confirms shot in semi auto
    - right trigger to activate and it just sits revved
        - stops revving once right trigger is released
        - constant rumble when up to speed
        - Small rumble when completely locked
        - prime to shooter and storage to prime, one button press

Find what is crashing and fix them

tuning
    Driverotation (kP and minimum)
    Drivedistance (kP and minimum)
    WaitUntilPeakShooterRPM (Percentage and wait time)
    IndexFromIntake, i.e prime a ball in intake (need to adjust rotations possibly)
