TODO LIST

Need to code:
    Different sets of autocode with different choosers
    Shuffleboard layout

Set up tests for
    - Camera
    - Driverotation
    - Autocode
        - Driverotation
        - Drivedistance
        - Driverotation(limelight.getHorizontalOffset())
        - WaitUntilPeakShooterRPM
    - Climber code
    - Shuffleboard
    - Basic controls
        - Intake backwards and forwards each mode
        - Index backwards and forwards each mode 
    - WaitUntilPeakShooterRPM
    - IndexRevolve

tuning
    Driverotation (kP and minimum)
    Drivedistance (kP and minimum)
    WaitUntilPeakShooterRPM (Percentage and wait time)
    IndexFromIntake, i.e prime a ball in intake (need to adjust rotations possibly)

Find what is crashing and fix them
